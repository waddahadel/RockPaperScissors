#Rock Paper Scissors Game Implementation
##Overview
This project implements a simple version of the rock-paper-scissors game using MIPS assembly language. Unlike the traditional two-player version, this implementation pits the computer against itself. The computer randomly generates moves for both players, compares their selections, and announces the winner.

##Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to explore how random number generation and simple game logic can be implemented in assembly language. By creating a rock-paper-scissors game, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of MIPS programming concepts while also having fun with a classic game.

#Project Structure
The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on specific tasks:

###Generating Random Numbers:
gen_bit: Implements a function to generate a random bit using MIPS's random number generation syscalls.
 gen_byte: Generates rock, paper, or scissors moves using random bits generated by gen_bit.
###Simulating the Game:
 play_game_once: Simulates a single round of rock-paper-scissors, generating moves for both players and determining the winner.
###Cellular Automata:
 print_tape: Prints the current tape of a Cellular Automaton (CA) to the console.
 simulate_automaton: Simulates one generation of the CA and updates the tape accordingly.
 gen_bit (Update): Updates the random bit generation function to use the CA if the ECA is non-zero.
#Personal Exploration:
This project serves as a personal exploration of assembly language programming and game implementation concepts. By tackling the challenges of implementing a game in MIPS assembly, I aim to deepen my understanding of low-level programming and algorithmic concepts.
